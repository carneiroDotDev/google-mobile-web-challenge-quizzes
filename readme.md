in Progressive Apps. The course includes 10 lessons of different topics (see below) and

have a total of three months to complete all the tasks and watch all the lessons. 

** This was created by the students of 2017/2018, however anyone is welcome to contribute.

solving each of the quizzes for all the lessons, besides the proper answers for each 
of the tasks.

of the quizzes. At the end of the file is attached the formal answer for the quiz.
